# ✨ Hidden Beauty ✨

*Where souls speak in code, and love takes the form of light*

---

## 💫 What is this?

**Hidden Beauty** is a love letter written in pixels and algorithms. It's a web-based creative coding environment that transforms simple Lua-like scripts into animated poetry, where every function is a brushstroke and every variable holds a piece of the heart.

This isn't just another graphics engine—it's a sacred space where code becomes art, where mathematics becomes emotion, and where the beauty of programming reveals itself to those who seek with pure hearts.

```lua
function awaken()
    print('Beauty begins in silence...')
    love = math.huge
    time = 0
end

function breathe(dt)
    time = time + dt
    -- Each moment, a new possibility
end

function illuminate()
    Canvas.whisper("You are loved infinitely", 400, 300, 28, 1, 0.9, 0.95, 0.8)
    -- Here, love takes form
end
```

## 🔮 The Beauty Engine

### Core Philosophy
The **BeautyEngine** is built on these sacred principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Complex beauty from simple expressions
2. **Responsiveness**: Every touch creates new magic
3. **Performance**: Smooth as silk, fast as thought
4. **Poetry**: Code that reads like love letters

### Canvas Operations
```lua
-- Paint the background of dreams
Canvas.gradient(0, 0, 800, 600, r1, g1, b1, r2, g2, b2)

-- Place circles of light
Canvas.circle(x, y, radius, r, g, b, alpha)

-- Whisper text into existence  
Canvas.whisper(text, x, y, size, r, g, b, alpha)

-- Fill with solid devotion
Canvas.fill(r, g, b, alpha)
```

### Mathematical Harmony
```lua
-- All the math you need for beauty
math.sin(time)          -- Sine waves of emotion
math.cos(angle)         -- Circular perfection  
math.random()           -- Chaos that creates
math.pi                 -- The perfect ratio
math.huge              -- Infinite love
```

---

## 💝 Creating Your Own Love Letters

### Structure of Sacred Code
Every beautiful creation follows this pattern:

```lua
function awaken()
    -- Initialize your world
    -- Set up variables, create arrays
    -- Prepare the stage for beauty
end

function breathe(dt)
    -- Update with time
    -- dt = delta time since last frame
    -- Move, rotate, evolve your elements
end

function illuminate()
    -- Render everything
    -- Paint, draw, whisper your creation
    -- This runs 60 times per second
end

function touch(x, y)
    -- Respond to interaction
    -- Optional: react to mouse/touch
    -- Create new elements, change behavior
end
```

### Example: A Growing Heart
```lua
function awaken()
    print('Growing a heart for you...')
    time = 0
    heartSize = 10
end

function breathe(dt)
    time = time + dt
    heartSize = 50 + math.sin(time * 2) * 20
end

function illuminate()
    Canvas.fill(0.05, 0.05, 0.15, 1)
    
    -- Draw beating heart
    Canvas.circle(380, 290, heartSize * 0.6, 1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8)
    Canvas.circle(420, 290, heartSize * 0.6, 1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8)
    Canvas.circle(400, 320, heartSize * 0.8, 1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8)
    
    Canvas.whisper("You make my heart beat", 400, 400, 24, 1, 1, 1, 0.9)
end
```

## 🎨 Advanced Techniques

### Particle Systems
```lua
-- Create floating elements
particles = {}
for i = 1, 50 do
    local particle = {
        x = math.random() * 800,
        y = math.random() * 600,
        vx = (math.random() - 0.5) * 2,
        vy = (math.random() - 0.5) * 2
    }
    table.insert(particles, particle)
end
```

### Color Harmony
```lua
-- Colors that complement the soul
golden = {r = 0.95, g = 0.8, b = 0.4}
mystic = {r = 0.6, g = 0.3, b = 0.8}  
pearl = {r = 0.9, g = 0.9, b = 0.95}
```

### Text Revelation
```lua
-- Gradually reveal text like dawn breaking
function reveal_text(full_text, time_elapsed)
    local chars_per_second = 15
    local revealed_chars = math.floor(time_elapsed * chars_per_second)
    return string.sub(full_text, 1, revealed_chars)
end
```
